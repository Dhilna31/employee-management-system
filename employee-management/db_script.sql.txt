Explanation
Auto Increment IDs:
BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT is used for id fields for unique primary keys.
Foreign Keys:
department_id in employees → references departments(id)
reporting_manager_id in employees → self-referencing FK to employees(id)
department_head_id in departments → references employees(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL:
Ensures that deleting a referenced employee or department does not delete dependent records, but sets the FK to NULL.
